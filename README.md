# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

In this project, you'll apply data science and machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Below is a step-by-step guide to approach the problem.

## üìä Step 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

### 1.1. Import Libraries
You'll need libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### 1.2. Load the Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle (Titanic Dataset) and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 1.3. Basic Data Exploration
Explore the structure of the dataset to understand its contents:
- Use `info()` to get an overview of the data types and missing values.
- Use `describe()` to generate summary statistics.
- Check for missing values.

## üßπ Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 2.1. Handle Missing Data
Some columns, like Age, Cabin, and Embarked, may have missing values. Handle them appropriately:
- Fill missing Age values with the median.
- Fill missing Embarked values with the mode.
- Drop the Cabin column since it has too many missing values.

### 2.2. Convert Categorical Data to Numerical
Convert categorical features (like Sex and Embarked) to numerical values using label encoding or one-hot encoding.

### 2.3. Drop Irrelevant Features
Drop irrelevant features such as Name, Ticket, and PassengerId, which are not useful for prediction.

## üîç Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3.1. Visualize Survival Rate by Gender
Visualize survival rates based on gender using a bar plot.

### 3.2. Visualize Survival Rate by Passenger Class
Visualize the survival rate by passenger class.

### 3.3. Visualize Survival Rate by Age
Create histograms to visualize the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.

---

## üîë Step 4: Feature Selection
Select the final set of features that are most relevant for prediction:
- Pclass (Passenger Class)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked_C, Embarked_Q (from One-Hot Encoding)

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Step 5: Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The target variable is 'Survived', while the features include the other columns from the dataset.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 6: Model Building

### 6.1. Logistic Regression
Start with Logistic Regression, a simple and effective model for binary classification problems.

### 6.2. Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Trees can handle non-linear relationships and are another good choice for classification tasks.

---

## üìà Step 7: Model Evaluation

### Evaluate both models using common metrics:
- **Accuracy Score** for both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
- **Confusion Matrix** to examine the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **Classification Report** to provide precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each model.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 8: Model Optimization

### 8.1. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize the hyperparameters of the Decision Tree model using techniques like GridSearchCV to improve performance.

### 8.2. Confusion Matrix
You can use a heatmap to visualize the confusion matrix for the Logistic Regression model. This will give you a clearer view of how well the model predicted the classes.
